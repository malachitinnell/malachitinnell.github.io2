<h1>Toxicity</h1>
<p>Toxicity is bad behavior and no good words they will say to something and actions. It's important to understand because Nearly half of players say they at least "sometimes" experience toxic behavior while playing, and around 21% report experiencing it "every time" or "often." Around two-thirds of players admit they're somewhat likely to stop playing a game if someone else is abusive toward them or exhibits toxic behavior. How can we combat toxicity? A vast majority, or about 92%, think there should be better solutions to enforce compliance with in-game codes of conduct and rules around toxic behavior.
