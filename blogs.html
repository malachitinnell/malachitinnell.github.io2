<p>The bad games where q-Bert I mean it wasn't that good you just have to go up and down the pyramid shape and help defeat enemies and save your friends I was hoping it was more cooler than that but it wasn’t

<p> What makes Pac man a good game is that you can, move around freely and take down opponents. 

What makes q-berut a bad game is that you can’t move freely you can only go one straight line which is kind of boring

<p> I picked dell because they are more smarter and faster and doesn’t take too long to load and there pc is way good and there clod has enough storage that it won’t forget anything you left behind any evidence the power off button is a simple hold and it turns off immediately on the waffle they have free games that you don’t have to add solitary, candy crush etc..

<p>I agree because it helps the computer company raise more computers and other ideas of how it can produce more of it.

<h1>Toxicity</h1>
<p>Toxicity is bad behavior and no good words they will say to something and actions. It's important to understand because Nearly half of players say they at least "sometimes" experience toxic behavior while playing, and around 21% report experiencing it "every time" or "often." Around two-thirds of players admit they're somewhat likely to stop playing a game if someone else is abusive toward them or exhibits toxic behavior. How can we combat toxicity? A vast majority, or about 92%, think there should be better solutions to enforce compliance with in-game codes of conduct and rules around toxic behavior.
