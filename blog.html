		  anime war fair bettwen other universes naruto got stranded on some other planet and found luffy&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Because i want to show the world how good i am at gaming and my parents</p>
<p>I played over the weekend was my hero academia on nintendo switch 

People i want to help them work on there gaming skills and achieve something they never had before and i want to change that future and shock the word of new things  might come to one day  when i came home today i almost dreamed about something today They made it into every game system and it makes things more interesting and more of its cool skills and the combos are decent theres super powerful opponents and there's a second game that is already out and it’s more interesting haves more characters and a very great combo power up.

<p> They created Pac man in a different way then now days  the first one created was in Japan and north America  which made it important that it expand it more and more around the state best games that are donkey Kong, pinball, streetfighter</p>
<a herf="https://www.lifewire.com/pac-man-video-game-729560"> pacman
<p>The bad games where q-Bert I mean it wasn't that good you just have to go up and down the pyramid shape and help defeat enemies and save your friends I was hoping it was more cooler than that but it wasn’t 
</p>
<a href="https://mashable.com/article/ai-beats-qbert"> q-bert
<p> What makes Pac man a good game is that you can, move around freely and take down opponents. 

What makes q-berut a bad game is that you can’t move freely you can only go one straight line which is kind of boring
</p>
<h1> blog 4 </h1>
<p> I picked dell because they are more smarter and faster and doesn’t take too long to load and there pc is way good and there clod has enough storage that it won’t forget anything you left behind any evidence the power off button is a simple hold and it turns off immediately on the waffle they have free games that you don’t have to add solitary, candy crush etc..     
</p>

<p>I agree because it helps the computer company raise more computers and other ideas of how it can produce more of it.

<h1> blog 2 </h1>
<h1>Toxicity</h1>
<p>Toxicity is bad behavior and no good words they will say to something and actions. It's important to understand because Nearly half of players say they at least "sometimes" experience toxic behavior while playing, and around 21% report experiencing it "every time" or "often." Around two-thirds of players admit they're somewhat likely to stop playing a game if someone else is abusive toward them or exhibits toxic behavior. How can we combat toxicity? A vast majority, or about 92%, think there should be better solutions to enforce compliance with in-game codes of conduct and rules around toxic behavior.

<h1>what makes a good team </h1>
<p>Evil genius  what makes them a good team cs:go they won against a unknown team in china and won 2-0 revatily easily they did well in league of legends they ended up in 3rd place and they are heading to the play-offs 1-3 they need to work on”If there’s one take-away, it should be that esports as a whole is in desperate need of real, qualified mental healthcare.”</p>
